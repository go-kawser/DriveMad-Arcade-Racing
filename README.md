# Drive Mad | High-Octane Arcade Racing

## **Note:** "I Will Not Give TypeScript Code Publicly"

**Professional, polished, single-page distribution build for the Drive Mad arcade driving game.**

This README is focused on the distributable build in `dist/` and provides a visitor-friendly overview, play/demo instructions, hosting tips, and guidance for contributors who want to work with the upstream source.

## Demo

> **Live demo:** If you host this `dist/` folder on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel or any static host, point the site root at the contents of `dist/`.

> **GIF / Video:** Add a short 5â€“10s gameplay GIF here to impress visitors.

## Highlights and Features

- Tight, arcade-style driving physics tuned for fast, addictive gameplay.
- Multiple tracks, vehicles and unlock able upgrades.
- Responsive UI that adapts to desktop and mobile browsers.
- Optimized production bundle: minified JS, compressed textures and cache-friendly assets.
- Input support: keyboard, gamepad (where supported), touch.

## Quick start--> run the distributable locally

These commands serve the `dist/` folder as a static site so you can demo locally. Pick one, PowerShell examples provided.

**Notes:**

- If your browser blocks local file loading (CORS/relative paths), always use a local server rather than opening `index.html` directly.
- For a production deployment, upload the contents of `dist/` to a static host.

### How to deploy

- **GitHub Pages:** push `dist/` contents to the `gh-pages` branch or use the repository settings to serve from `docs/`/`dist/` depending on your workflow.
- **Netlify / Vercel:** drag & drop the `dist/` folder or connect the repo and set the publish directory to `dist/`.
- **Any static host:** This Drive Mad will serve this build.

### Typical distribution contents

The `dist/` folder is the production-ready package. Typical layout:

```
dist/
index.html   # only single entry page
```

Replace or add assets (images, audio) carefully--> filenames may be hashed in production builds.

### Controls

**Default controls:**

- **Move:** Arrow keys or WASD
- **Brake / Reverse:** S or Down
- **Boost / Nitro:** Shift or Space
- **Horn / Action:** H or E
- **Pause / Menu:** Esc

**Gamepad:** standard gamepads should map to the same actions (axis for steering, triggers for throttle/brake).

### Technical overview (for maintainers)

- **Engine:** Lightweight custom engine or framework-agnostic JS build (HTML5 Canvas / WebGL).
- **Build output:** minified JS bundles, single-page `index.html` entry, asset manifest.
- **Performance:** uses texture atlases and audio sprites where possible; lazy-loads non-critical assets.

If you're viewing only the `dist/` folder and want to work on features, locate the upstream source (likely in a sibling `src/` or root of the repo). Typical development flow:

1. Clone the repository (source).
2. Install dependencies (e.g., `npm install`).
3. Run dev server (`npm run dev`).
4. Build production (`npm run build`) which outputs into `dist/`.

### Common troubleshooting

- Blank screen / console errors: check the browser console for 404s (missing assets) or syntax errors. Ensure `dist/` is served over HTTP(S).
- Audio not playing: many browsers block auto play, interact once (click/tap) to enable audio.
- Controls not responsive on mobile: ensure touch mappings are enabled in the source and that `touch-action` CSS is not blocking events.

#### Contributing

**If you have the source repository and want to contribute:**

1. Fork the repo.
2. Open an issue describing the feature or bug.
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`.
4. Write clear commit messages and tests where applicable.
5. Submit a pull request with a description and testing notes.

**Contribution tips:**

- Keep builds reproducible; commit lockfiles (`package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock`) if present.
- Add small, focused PRs. For visual changes include before/after screenshots or GIFs.

#### License

This `dist/` bundle is distributed under the MIT License by default. Replace or update with your chosen license. See the `LICENSE` file in the repository root for authoritative terms.

If you'd like, I can also:

- Created a polished demo GIF from recordings (if you provide a gameplay clip).
- Create a compact `README` for the repo root with badges, contributor guidelines, and a roadmap.

If you want the README to reference exact build commands and scripts, point me to the project root or share `package.json`, I will update the doc to match the real scripts.
